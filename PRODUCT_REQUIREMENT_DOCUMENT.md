# Product Requirement Document

## Requirements Feature 1

Your task is to create an web application using an API & MySQL for the backend and VueJS and Tailwind CSS for the frontend.

- The application should have one page
- Input field which allows users to enter a hand of cards
  - Each card should be separated by a space
    - Example: `2 4 6 J K A`
- Valid cards are: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `10`, `J`, `Q`, `K`, `A`
- A `Random` button, when this is clicked a random number of valid cards separated by space fills the input field
- A `Play` button, when this is clicked a random hand of cards with the same amount of cards that the user entered should be generated and displayed to the user.
- The user’s hand of cards should then be compared to the generated hand of cards. Each card in the player’s hand should be compared to the card in the same position in the generated hand. Highest value card wins. For example:
  - Player’s hand: `5 7 A K`
  - Generated Hand: `4 8 K Q`
- A score should be calculated for the player and generated hand, in this example it would be:
  - Player: `3`
  - Generated: `1`
  - | | Card #1 | Card #2 | Card #3 | Card #4 |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | User | 5 | 7 | A | K |
    | Game | 4 | 8 | K | Q |
    | Winner | User | Game | User | User |
- The results of the game should then be shown to the user
- The results should also be stored in the database, each row should represent one play this should include **at least**:
  - the user’s ID,
  - the user’s score
  - the generated hand score
  - result of the play
  - timestamps
  - **Example**:
    - | user_id | user_score | game_score | user_won | created_at | updated_at |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | 1 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 2022-04-01 12:00:00 | 2022-04-01 12:00:00 |
- A paginated leaderboard should be shown at the bottom of page with **at least**:
  - position in the leaderboard
  - each user’s name
  - the total number of games
  - total number of hands that they have won
  - first game date
  - latest game date
  - **Example**:
    - | # | User | Total Games | Won Games | Latest won game | Latest lost game |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | 1 | John | 10 | 2 | March 4th 2025 | March 4th 2025 |
      | 2 | Mary | 7 | 5 | January 1st 2024 | March 1st 2025 |
- Validation should be included on the API. Any validation messages should be displayed to the user
  - for instance, to ensure that all of the cards are valid.
